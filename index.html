                <summary><h2>Monday, June 13th</h2></summary>
                <p>I'm backlogging a little (it's actually the 20th today) because this is a story of its own that is very important I write about here, but don't want to combine with the routine to-dos because that's separate.</p>
                <p>Update: As I'm writing it, I notice it's actually quite long, so I'll go ahead and split it in three parts, one for each day.</p>

                <p>The story is about how I ended up moderating stages at the <a href="https://www.wearedevelopers.com/world-congress#/" target="_blank">WeAreDevelopers World Congress 2022</a> and how that went.</p>
                <p>I first heard about this conference back in December I think, when Deni from TPOW (<span class="strikeThrough">my</span> his discord study community) wanted to apply for being a speaker. I was of course mindblown by the scale of the event, the speakers that have been there in previous years (even <em>I</em> had heard of them lol) and was super excited that it's going to be held in Berlin! Which is where I am!</p>
                <p>Fast forward a few months, Deni ended up getting hired by WeAreDevs, handling social medias and helping with the organization of the event. Crazy how that escalated, good job man, I'm proud of you!</p>
                <p>I initially signed up as a volunteer. I had no way to afford a proper ticket and I was going to be way out of my depth anyway, so I thought it'd be great to have something to do and a direct way to meet people. Besides, I've gotten so much help from the tech community, I thought this would be a lovely way to give something back.</p>
                <p>When I told Deni I'd been accepted as a volunteer, he was like "but no wait, here's a code for a ticket and then you can just hang out with me while I do social media stuff!" - yes please and thank you :D I got my ticket and waited patiently for the event.</p>
                <p>On the weekend right before it, he wrote me that they're a bit short on moderators and that I should do it. "It's no big deal" he said, "You can totally do it", he said. I had no idea what a moderator does and he told me I'd just have to ask the speakers a few questions after their talk, like "how did it go", "how was the audience" etc. and that' he'd probably be there too.</p>
                <p>Well, that I can indeed do, sign me up!</p>
                <p>On Monday the 13th I received an email from Gerry with the "moderators briefing" doc. As I was reading the eight pages of it, I slowly began to realize how much Deni had undersold the assignment to me and oversold <em>me</em> to Gerry.</p>
                <p>Hol' up! I am assigned to two stages. I'm spending a full day at each stage. I'm getting up on that stage <em>first</em> to make all the event-related announcements. And then I'm also <em>introducing each of the speakers for that stage</em>. By myself too, Deni had other responsibilities. Wait, whaaaat??</p>
                <p>Well. It was the day before the event. I was invited for a rehearsal in a few hours. I'd agreed to do it, Deni had convinced Gerry, Gerry had graciously allowed me to do it. There was no turning back, I was commited.</p>
                <p>I rolled up my metaphorical sleeves and started familiarizing myself with the speakers and their topics as instructed in the briefing.</p>
                <p>Automotive OS. Cloud Native Data Management. Kubernetes. SonarQube. Reactive microservices. Serverless landscape. Headless commerce. I don't know what any of those words mean. I don't know who any of those people are, and they all sound wildly impressive.</p>
                <p>Information overload doesn't even begin to cover it.</p>
                <p>It was becoming apparent I probably won't be able to remember all of that and it's likely I won't have time to write it all down either.</p>
                <p>I went to the rehearsal, to at least glimpse what I was getting myself into.</p>
                <p>The event space was <em>massive</em>. There were countless stages, people buzzing about setting things up, people already piling up to check in.</p>
                <p>I was relieved to find my stage for the first day was one of the cosiest and least intimidating looking ones and felt a bit of relief. Rike, the stage manager, was very on top of things, knew what was going on and had answers to all of my questions. Her presence definitely put me more at ease. Then I met Johannes, the first of the speakers I was introducing. Luckily, he was going to talk about git and code reviews, which was one of the few comprehensible for me topics. It was his first in-person talk too, so it felt very comforting to start the experience together.</p>
                <p>The rehearsal didn't last long, so I then went to help out with some of the checkins at the door.</p>
                <p>In the evening I, as a moderator, was invited to the speakers' welcoming drinks at the hotel. I was mostly excited to hang out with Deni - he was my first internet-stranger-turned-friend from my coding journey and he'd done so much for me, including getting me this insane opportunity, so I was looking forward to get the chance to meet in person. Besides, meeting people is kind of the point of these conferences, isn't it, so this get together seemed like a must.</p>
                <p>I kind of wish I could've split in two and also gone home to do homework, but that's not how it works. I was hoping by meeting some of the speakers, I'd have an easier time with introducing them later.</p>
                <p>And it did help! I was lucky enough to chat with Johannes some more, and meet Noaa and Michael who were also at my stages. I met Marc too, who was a more experienced moderator (and a speaker) and was kind enough to reassure me a bit.</p>
                <p>All in all, good times. On my way home I thought "it's ok, I got this, it'll be fun!"</p>
                <p>I set myself a deadline of 2am and kept reading about the speakers and their topics before eventually getting to bed.</p>
                <p>(to be continued...)</p>

                <summary><h2>Saturday, June 11th</h2></summary>
                <p>Alright. I'm here at a much more civilized hour today, let's get things done.</p>
            <p>I have two projects going right now and it's a bit tough to choose which one to work on. But since Alex hasn't sent me any files or texts for his portfolio, I'll go for this one.</p>
            <p>I'll start with a list of things I want to do and then go do them.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Media queries - find out why they work when resizing a desktop window, but not on a physically smaller screen & fix it; think about moving the sidebar instead of hiding it completely;</li>
                <li>Navbar - make it stick to the top of the page; fix the hover background;</li>
                <li>Hamburger menu - it's inevitable for mobile view, could put the sidebar in there too maybe;</li>
                <li>Footer - make one;</li>
                <li>Goals page - update content, improve appearance; consider columns instead of current "layout";</li>
                <li>Notes and Resources pages - not even sure how to phrase what I want to do, so good luck with the googling lol but I want the text for each topic to be hidden and only revealed when you click on the heading (I believe that's what toggle is actually, let's find out); bonus points for adding more content to those two;</li>
                <li>JavaScript - is it time? If I want toggles and hamburgers, it probably is;</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This should keep me occupied for awhile, will report back before I take the dog out in a couple of hours.</p>
            <p>Oh, I thought of another thing -</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Journal & Step By Step pages - add an option to sort them by oldest vs latest;</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <hr>
            <p>I've made some progress. I have a footer now (and right after I wrote this remembered to put it on the other pages too :P ), even though I don't know if I need one at the moment. It's good to have though, to remind me to make it functional later on.</p>
            <p>The navbar is better now, it's fixed at the top and the hover background is more proportional.</p>
            <p>I made a js file and am writing my first function, which is for toggling some text. I still have to figure out how to target the one I intend to, but it's a start.</p>
            <p>I'm going to save my progress and head out for a walk. Maybe I do some more stuff when I come back although I should probably do some cleaning of the house instead. I hate cleaning. Can I train my dog and/or cat to do it for me?</p>
            <br>
            <hr>
            <p>Woah, big day for my little journal today!</p>
            <p>After playing around with the js toggle function for awhile, I just couldn't get it to do what I wanted. Stackoverflow was full of wrapper divs and jQuery, the more I searched, the more complicated the answers seemed to be getting and I <em>knew</em> there had to be a simpler solution.</p>
            <p>I finally thought of just inspecting a page with toggling stuff, which happened to be the MDN side menu, and found the simplest of solutions - ***the &lt;details&gt; tag!!!***</p>
            <p>It was love at first sight and I went through the pain of putting it all over the place. Hope I don't change my mind about it later lol.</p>
            <p>I also fixed the media query, but I'm not entirely sure what was its problem. It was set for a max-width, which as far as I'm concerned should work for any device (and it <em>does</em> in other projects I've used it in). But it just didn't want to cooperate until I copied the exact same thing, but for max-device-width. It is what it is, I may dig more into it later though, because the inconsistency bugs me.</p>
            <p>I think that's it for today. Next time I'll work more on the sidebar and give the hamburger menu a go. I also haven't done much in terms of content which doesn't really surprise me anymore BUT I <em>will</em> get there eventually.</p>
            <p>Now it's time for bed (but first, GitHub).</p>

            <summary><h2>Friday, June 10th</h2></summary>
            <p>Crazy how fast time goes by, where did the last two weeks go?</p>
            <p>I'm itching to fix soooo many things in this journal, but now is not the time for it (because it's the middle of the night, as usual). But since I've shared it with a few people (hi!) in the past couple of days, I thought I'd at least write something to remind myself to keep working on it.</p>
            <p>I've been slowly catching up with the 100Devs classes, got through APIs and have OOP coming up. I love learning about things I hear and read about aaaall the time, it's nice to finally be able to understand what people are saying. It's tough to be patient with these things, but I'd say I'm doing a good job with it.</p>
            <p>As I opened this in VS Code I realised I don't have ANY folders, everything is in the main one and it hurts to look at that side-bar (I mean the VS Code one, not that the journal one is any more appealing lol). I remember I tried to fix that once but then, of course, everything broke, because the sources change and I have to go over each one to reflect that. I got confused, it didn't work and I undid it all.</p>
            <p>I'm fairly certain I know better now and it should be easier, but let's see. I should at least make a media folder right now though, or I won't be able to sleep. And now that I have, edit all the related tags.</p>
            <p>Well, it does look much better now. I did however totally fall into the rabbit hole again and ended up spending over an hour on little things here and there.</p>
            <p>Note to self - do your best to polish any headers, footers and sidebars on the index page before making other pages, because every change from there on has to be implemented on the rest of the pages too and that's annoying. Even if it's just copy/pasting. OR is there a better way?</p>
            <p>There's a lot more I want to write about, but at this point I just have to go to bed.</p>
            <p>Tomorrow, if I'm smart enough, I'll open this journal before midnight and catch up with the writing.</p>

            <summary><h2>Thursday, May 27th</h2></summary>
            <p>Well hello there, my old friend.</p>
            <p>I've been away from you a lot, but that doesn't mean I've abandoned you!</p>
            <p>As I often point out in my actual journal (and sometimes here too), I <em>love</em> journaling, even if I don't always get around to it. And since I've gotten back to the other one full-time, I thought I'd make an appearence here as well.</p>
            <p>Speaking of full-time, I am no longer employed! I've had a shift per week in the last month, but that's it. I now get to focus on learning.</p>
            <p>Except... like I said last time - the more time passes, the more difficult it becomes to get back to things. It's worth repeating lest I forget again (first time I've ever used the word "lest", lol, don't even know how it came to me).</p>
            <p>I'd also like to point out that I sure wish I'd completed my notes page last time for exactly the reason I mentioned then too - "it's important to keep track of things, so I can easily refresh my memory when needed". That's why I keep falling in the "two steps forward, one step back" trap (and I did totally forget about this, good I wrote it down). That's also why I have a tough time getting back on track after a break - because I don't have a good way to revise things without going over all the resources I've already gone over.</p>
            <p>Ah. The pain of learning from your own mistakes. Leon (among others) says a million times to make anki cards and how important spaced repetition is. But apparently I can't just listen to people saying things a million times, no. I have to draw my own conclusions. C'est la vie.</p>
            <p>BUT!!! All that being said, this week I FINALLY got started on Alex's website! And in just two days it already looks way better than this one.</p>
            <video controls="controls" src="media/Screen Recording 2022-05-26 at 23.03.25.mov" alt="Video screenshot of a musician's portfolio website"></video>
            <p>Here's what I've learned from the experience so far:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I always remember way more than I think I do;</li>
                <li>Ok, it might not be actual "remembering", I do still have to look up most of the syntax. But what I seem to be absorbing well is <em>how things work</em> - the most important part! Yay me!</li>
                <li>Coding always makes me feel unreasonably good about myslef (just like making desserts does!). Am I doing it wrong?</li>
                <li>CSS is still a pain in the ass though;</li>
                <li>It's surprisingly difficult to not get carried away with gradients;</li>
            </ul>
            <p>And while this is a great place to start, I do still have a lot of work to do. Which is why I came here in the first place - to make a list for tomorrow so I don't forget what I want to edit and build.</p>
            <p>I don't know why I thought I'd just come here, make my list and go to bed. There was no way to not get carried away with writing and editing stuff after not opening this journal for over a month and it's now been two hours.</p>
            <p>Oh well. On we go.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A hamburger menu of sorts for mobile view;</li>
                <li>A footer;</li>
                <li>Social media and button icons;</li>
                <li>Contact form fine tuning;</li>
                <li>Customise the audio player section;</li>
                <li>Make third card horizontal for tablet view;</li>
                <li>Figure out how to make the contact form functional;</li>
                <li>Un-float the cards and flex them instead;</li>
                <li>Figure out what happens when you "book" something;</li>
                <li>Make a Github repo! Totally forgot about GitHub, damn!</li>
            </ul>
            <p>And if I decide to go further down the design rabbit hole (which I don't think I should at this point):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Optimise navbar;</li>
                <li>Make navbar button borders (if I stick with them) gradient to fit the hover filler;</li>
                <li>Optimise all other buttons;</li>
                <li>Improve contrast ratios;</li>
                <li>Add underline swoosh here and there;</li>
                <li>Improve header image fit;</li>
                <li>Add animations and smooth scroll;</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I'm sure there's more to add, but my brain is fried. I won't even mention any to-dos outside of that project, including this one.</p>
            <p>I need to have something finished to show to the world and myself and Alex's website will be it. Hopefully soon!</p>
            <p>K, good night now.</p>

            <summary><h2>Tuesday, Apr 19th</h2></summary>
            <p>Lol, two whole weeks is "embarassing". Try two whole months!</p>
            <p>The more time passes, the more difficult it becomes to get back to things.</p>
            <p>Like, what do I even say now? I've learned many things in this time, but I did also have a long break.</p>
            <p>Do I write about what I've learned, do I write about breaks, or jump straight into my intentions for the future?</p>
            <p>To be fair, it doesn't matter. Writing <em>anything</em> counts. Out of the past, present and future, the present is always good to aknowledge, so here we go.</p>
            <p>Today I'm going to start with my notes page and write everything I remember about HTML and CSS. I should add resources too, because it's definitely not like I know it all - I will have to go back and learn more about both at some point.</p>
            <p>That might actually take up all my power for the day, but next up would be some JavaScript notes. I have learned a lot about it, but I also know it's a big beast. It's important to keep track of things, so I can easily refresh my memory when needed.</p>
            <p>I'm very tempted to continue with all the courses BUT I don't think I should do that just yet. I don't want to move on leaving too many knowledge gaps behind and I am entering the front/backend intersection so now would be a good time for a revision. No new material until May 1st!</p>
            <p>I went back and reread all my entries here - I got curious. I do see the value in documenting my journey. Especially since consistency is my biggest foe, it's very helpful to be able to retrace my steps.</p>
            <p>Something I noticed is that I do seem to be moving in a "two steps forward, one step back" fashion. And I'm doing it again. Returning to HTML/CSS notes is definitely a step back, but it does feel necessary if I'm going to make the next two steps forward. So I'll take it, but it's good to notice the pattern.</p>
            <p>Also, I'd like to remind myself that this entire journal happened <em>after</em> my last month-long break! I can't wait to see what comes after this one.</p>

            <p>Well, this is embarassing. It's been <em>two whole weeks!</em></p>
            <p>I suppose that's the reality of learning on the side of a full time job. I did have ten days off which helped get this thing going, but then I went back to work and no longer had the time.</p>
            <p>My GitHub streak is followed by an equally long empty one. That's fine though. I have been reading and watching random things every day, just nothing too focused and no actual coding.</p>
            <p>Oh, but wait! I see I haven't written anything about JavaScript yet! I did get started with it, I even got to the Intermediate section of <a href="link">Angela Yu's bootcamp</a>. It really isn't that bad. Many of the things covered so far, have been pretty much the same as the C and Python basics from CS50 - variables, loops, arrays, etc. I get now what people mean with "you just need to learn one language well, you can pick up any other after that". That's fair. Problem is, I haven't learned <em>any</em> language well yet. But I'm going to fix that with JavaScript. Hopefully.</p>
            <p>Anyway, today I'm finally going to get started with the 100devs layouts. By now there's seven of them and I definitely shouldn't have been so cocky about the pace beeing too slow. We are starting with JavaScript there now too though, so it's time to get that HTML/CSS homework out of the way.</p>
            <p>I'm a little apprehensive (had to google that one) about the fact that I haven't done a good job at documenting what I'm actually learning. I'm not beating myself over it, because I've had one day off out of the past ten, but I'm just noting that I shoulg probably put it on top of my to-do list (ooohh, should I make a to-do list sidebar?) for my next day off.</p>
            <p>Now back to those layouts before I forget everything I've learned so far.</p>

            <p>I haven't worked on the journal these days. I have been going through the bootcamp and I'm nearing JavaScript. Again.</p>
            <p>I've been a bit apprehensive about it, but I think that mostly started because by the time I got to it in cs50, I wasn't sure if I shouldn't maybe continue with C and Python. Also because cs50 was quite a lot for a newbie like me and I suppose I kinda just drew the line at JavaScript and decided to leave it for "later".</p>
            <p>Well, it's "later" now.</p>
            <p>I feel like I need more practice with html and css first, but let's face it - they are still going to be very present regardless.</p>
            <p>So tomorrow shall be my first JavaScript day, wish me luck.</p>

            <p>New day, new month, new me? Lol no, that's not how it works.</p>
            <p>I need a plan for today, otherwise I'll just end up staring at the screen and scrolling through random things without actually doing anything.</p>
            <p>I think I'll explore <a href ="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/" target="_blank">Angela Yu's bootcamp</a> a bit more today. I've paid for it, might as well.</p>
            <p>I'll also revisit <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/" target="_blank">The Odin Project</a>'s CSS foundations to make sure I haven't missed anything.</p>
            <p>My goal with that is to fill out my notes for HTML and CSS, summarizing everything I've learned so far, in a way that makes them comprehensive enough to no longer need other resources on subjects I've already covered. Quite the sentence but it's ok, I get what I mean.</p>
            <p>Subgoal is to add some tweaks to this project even though I don't have any specific ideas in mind yet. Let's see how it goes.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>So I have been going over the bootcamp and I do know a lot of those things already, which makes me feel quite good about myself, not gonna lie.</p>
            <p>Then I realised what is it that I keep forgetting - the <a href="https://learn.shayhowe.com/" target="_blank">Shay Howe</a> reading homework for 100devs! Every once in a while I notice someone on twitter posting some cool things they've done to their CSS layouts and I'm like "But <em>how</em>?? Leon didn't say anything about that..." before I see their Shay Howe-related caption. So that's <em>howe!</em> (sorry I had to)</p>
            <p>I did come up with something to add here - a little section on the side (could it even be an &lt;aside&gt;??) where I put a photo of myself with a bit of text about me/this project.</p>
            <p>I've also been working on a "step by step" page, which is literally what it says. I'm curious how many steps it takes to build something "presentable" (as per my definition of it in relation to my <a href="goals.html" target="_blank">goals</a>). And, of course, if anyone asks me "how do I make a journal for myself" I can show them precisely how I've done it.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>*le sigh* I foolishly decided to go for it with the side bar and now I've broken everything.</p> 
            <p>Thank you, git & GitHub, for keeping the previous version intact, I don't know what I'd do without you. Certainly worth the headaches of setting you up properly.</p>
            <p>I hope this side bar is worth it too one day, but today it isn't. I'm going to put it out there anyway because I do like the general idea, but there's still many things to improve.</p>

            <p>Oops, almost missed this one.</p>
            <p>I haven't had a productive day, I'm just here for my green square, don't judge.</p>
            <p>I'm pretty sure I made some other changes last night that I saved to the files, but it was 3am so I really can't tell you what they were.</p>
            <p>One thing I tried to learn (or understand rather) is what is Node.js and what does it do exactly. I have to admit, that's the first concept I've encountered so far that is genuinely confusing. When I googled it, I expected to see "language" or "framework", but no <cite>"Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment"</cite>. Thanks!</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-exactly-is-node-js-ae36e97449f5" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a> helped a little, but I'll look more into it tomorrow</p>

            <summary><h2>Sunday, Jan 30th</h2></summary>
            <p>Starting this entry early, I'll write as I go along today.</p>
            <p>I fixed the nested list, which was apparently so basic that I found the solution on <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Create-a-Nested-List-in-HTML" target="_blank">wikiHow</a> lol</p>
            <p>I realised I have to post a link to this out in the world so I put a quick disclaimer on top in case anyone reads it. Also because I want to make it look like a (don't even know what they're called) notification banner? Thought it would be a nice thing to learn.</p>
            <p>I then hosted a quick TPOW weekly catch-up voice chat to see how everyone is doing. I'm not much of a speaker, so this is helpful to get used to it. Kitchen communication tends to be contained within 1-5 words which isn't really sufficient here :D</p>
            <p>We were talking about how to get started on a project and I had to praise this study journal idea.</p>
            <p>It's the simplest of things, very low-pressure as you can totally just start with html and it's very easy to grow, because you always come up with little adjustments to make.</p>
            <p>I also noted that I've chosen to see it as a never-ending project, because there'll always be more things I want to tweak the more I learn. It's nice to know I don't <em>have to</em> finish it because it will never <em>be</em> finished. No deadline does take a lot of pressure off of it.</p>
            <p>Anyway, I pushed this to GitHub a bit prematurely (as in, before I saved my files lol) so I'll give it another go, hopefully I don't forget anything this time.</p>
            <p>Oh, one last thing - since it feels like I'm wrapping this up for the day, tomorrow I want to think about how exactly I'd like to format these journal entries, because it bugs me that it's always different. Yes, it's a journal and allowed to be disorganized, but it's a <em>study</em> journal, so I feel like it shouldn't be.</p> 
            <p>Have I said "study journal" enough times today already?</p>

            <p>Haven't done much today, but it's not too bad.</p>
            <p>I caught up with the 100devs videos (and understood why I was having issues with that floating navbar yesterday, that's what I get for jumping straight in lol).</p>
            <p>I practiced my typing and realized that's a great way to make yourself look busy - <a href="https://www.keybr.com/" target="_blank">here's a link</a> if you're ever in need :D I did find it a bit annoying; I get the benefits of using randomly generated letter sequences, but figuring them out for sure affects my speed and accuracy. That being said, I'm noticing that I'm already typing way faster, so they must be doing something right. Those Xs really got me though.</p>
            <p>I just started reading a bit of Shay Howe but it's late so it probably won't last long.</p>
            <p>Oh, he did however remind me of the <a href="https://validator.w3.org/" target="_blank">W3C validators</a> which I'm using to check my code for this, which is how I ended up opening VS Code at all today. Fun fact, there's no point in putting lists inside of paragraphs, which as I'm typing feels pretty obvious, but I've been doing it all along so I ended up having to edit them all.</p>
            <p>I also added target="_blank" to all the links so they open in new tabs now. Halleluja! I <em>hate it</em> when they don't, why do people do that??</p>
            <p>Woah, my elbow is sore (bad posture) but I don't seem to be able to stop myself from typing. That website broke me, don't do it.</p>
            <p>I'm going to walk away from the keyboard <span class="strikeThrough">now</span>.</p>
            <p>(Okay but first I'm just going to list some things I want to look up tomorrow and would surely forget if I don't write down)</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In goals.html I have a sub-list which apparently is not allowed or at least not the way I'm doing it; my CSS is all good though, so yay me!</li>
                <li>Speaking of CSS, this handwrite-y font is cute for the dates here but looks terrible on all other pages, have to find one I can use for that and maybe the navbar.</li>
                <li>There was something else too? Ah yes, fix that float, girl!</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Walking away now.</p>

            <br>
            <p>P.S. GitHub pro tip - push things around midnight and you can green up two days in 5 min! I won't tell if you don't.</p>

            <summary><h2 title="learned a new trick, had to try it">Friday, Jan 28th</h2></summary>
            <p>I may not be done for the day yet, but the day is almost done, so I'll just go ahead.</p>
            <p>Usual focus issues, blah blah, maybe I'll get better at it, maybe I won't.</p>

            <p>I did however manage to do some of the things I intended to and still have time for a bit more. I started with the easiest, which was picking out some colours and fonts. Didn't spend too much time on it, don't know if I love them, but for the purposes - totally sufficient. I'm <em>not</em> a designer. It's <em>not</em> what I'm learning right now.</p>

            <p>Once I got my colours, I really wanted to style that navbar. I was supposed to read more about CSS before I jump into it, but I didn't and so it doesn't really look the way I want it to AND my stylesheet is a bit of a mess, but to be fair - I don't hate it either. (gonna write more later)</p>

            <p>(It's later now) Got some new ideas, will work on them in the following days. Here's what I did today:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>CSS - read a little bit about it from <a href="https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/Css/css_navbar.asp" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS" target="_blank">here</a>;</li>
                    <li>Styling - linked fonts and selected colour palette;</li>
                    <li>Navbar - this one was a pain in the ass, but I almost got it to look the way I want!</li>
                    <li>Title attribute - saw this trick on twitter and snuck it in so I don't forget it.</li>
                </ul>
            
            <p>What I want to do tomorrow:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pages - I still don't have much on any of the others; also after I looked at my screenshots, I thought it would be cool to make a page for them too, that way I'd get to play around with images and I'll keep a visual track of my progress; another page idea is a to-do list, but that could be part of Goals I suppose;</li>
                    <li>GitHub - Still haven't checked out the messages. Maybe I'll try to do today's commits one by one but that sounds even less practical;</li>
                    <li>OPEN LINKS IN NEW TABS GODDAMNIT!</li>
                </ul>

            <summary><h2>Thursday, Jan 27th</h2></summary>
            <p>
                Which brings us to today.
                I intended to do more, but as you can see, I'm having a hard time focusing these days. What I'd still like to do by the end of the day is:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reorganize this html file - it's only been a week and it's already getting pretty long. Maybe I didn't think this through. I have to look up how people organize super long html files and is there a better way to do it for what I'm using it.</li>
                    <li>Make the other pages - once I figure out the org...</li>
                </ul>
                Ohhh wait a moment! I'm getting too caught up in trying to make things perfect. This is not the time for that. Come on, let's get those pages up, so I can have something to work on later!
            
            <p>
                See, that's much better! I have all my pages now and created a CSS file too. It's crazy how far three simple declarations can go. It's midnight now, so I'm going to head to bed.
            </p>
            <p>
                What I did today:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pages - created the rest of the html pages
                    <li>Navigation - made all pages accessible from each other</li>
                    <li>Sections - for each journal entry, with alternating classes to separate them better visually</li>
                    <li>CSS - created the file and made a couple of declarations</li>
                    <li>Journal - wrote entries for today and the previous two days</li>
                    <li>GitHub - been committing all along</li>
                </ul>
            <p>Not bad given how much time I wasted scrolling through twitter lol</p>
            <p>
                What I want to do next:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Other pages - add some content to Resources and Notes, consider writing an About page</li>
                    <li>CSS - read more, pick colour palette and fonts, style nav bar</li>
                    <li>GitHub - improve my commit messages, now I'm pretty much writing one for the batch of commits but it doesn't appear very practical</li>
                </ul>

                Alright, so it's actually two days later now and I'm writing this as a catch-up. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I also just deleted everything I'd written, because I got way off track and forgot what my point was.
            </p>
            <p>
                Does anyone else struggle to stay focused sometimes? What, everyone? Good, I'm not alone then :D
            </p>
            <p>
                Since I'll have to write an entry for today as well, I'll just jump straight to it and share what I did on Tuesday:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fixed my git/GitHub issues - I made a second account to "start over" and was having troubles connecting the correct ones. I'd be logged in as account2 on my machine and on GitHub, but when trying to commit, I'd get an error that account1 isn't authorised to do that. Drove me nuts. Fixed it. Felt great.</li>
                    <li>Pushed my journal - as I'd given up on the previous issue, I had just uploaded my journal files to GitHub via the upload file button. Don't shame me. Then I had to find out how to select the version of the file I want. Ah, the ups and downs we go through...</li>
                    <li>Edited the index.html - actually did that before pushing. Applied some of the new things I've learned from 100devs.</li>
                </ul>
            
            <p>
                What I learned:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>(aaaand my mind went blank and I drifted away straight back to twitter. *le sigh*)</li>
                    <li>git/GitHub configuration - I feel less intimidated by it now and can't wait to collect some green squares soon!</li>
                    <li>Working with VS Code - I used my dislike to it as an excuse to not build anything. Lame, I know. That's why I sucked it up and just kept going. I dislike it less now.</li>
                    <li>Probably some more things, that I've already forgotten, so they don't really count, do they?</li>
                </ul>
            
            <p>
                Now let's jump back to the present.

            <p>
                Okay, I actually learned stuff today!
                Let’s back up a bit. So I made a twitter account because apparently it’s important. Whatever, I just deleted reddit from my phone, I could replace it with another time-draining thing, right? Anyway, you know how social media is and right now everyone seems to be doing 100devs.
            </p>
            <p>
                I love jumping to new things just so I don’t have to keep doing what I’m doing, so I’ve really been itching to give it a go.
                I was warned against it because “don’t waste your time, 30 weeks are you kidding me, you can do it so much faster, do the odin project, etc.”. And I don’t disagree, but the fomo is real, y’all.
                So I came home after work, realized it’s Friday and I’m too broke to go out and have fun, was probably going to waste a couple hours watching random netflix shit. A great time to waste on 100devs!
            </p>
            <p>
                First up, I loved Leon, which is what made me stick around. I do, however, have to admit I totally see the “time wasting” point. Not judging, I understand different people learn at different paces and if I were a teacher, I’d go super slow too.
            </p>
            <p>
                Those who want to speed it up, are free to do so.
                Which is what I did. Like, way up.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m glad I stuck with it though, because honestly, this was the most comprehensive explanation of html I’ve come across so far.
            </p>
            <p>
                I started with cs50, which was mostly c and python. I only got a glimpse of html/css and javascript towards the end. And it was a bit “come on, you’ve done c and python already, this is no big deal” style, which I guess mostly means rushed. 
                I then did The Odin Projects Foundations part, again with a bit html and css (haven’t done the js part yet). It was easy enough, sure. Comprehensive? They probably get to that later.

            <p>
                My key takeaways from the first three classes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Separation of concerns - I loved this way of putting it and the idea of compartmentalizing everything. HTML is for content, CSS is for style and JS is for function.</li>
                    <li>I loved the peanut m&ms analogy too - The peanut is the essence, which is HTML. The chocolate is a bonus, which is CSS and then there’s a thin coating to pimp it up (I personally know the m&ms coating’s true purpose and it sure isn’t an “optional” thing, but I’ll let it slide lol), which is JavaScript. For the sake of accessibility even when the internet is shit, it’s important to focus on the essence and keep it light on the bonus and pimping it up parts.</li>
                    <li>Each tag has its purpose. Its purpose should never be style.</li>
                    <li>The “head” contains the information that is for the browser. The “body” is what is shown to the user. The “you can see my sexy body but you can’t see what’s inside my head” was hilarious and a great way to remember it.</li>
                    <li>Drawing out the elements of a webpage and deconstructing it goes a long way towards understanding what to use where.</li>
                    <li>The tags themselves are easy to lookup and use (mdn is a friend)</li>
                </ul>
            
            <p>
                What I did today:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Watched first three classes of 100devs</li>
                    <li>Wrote a proper journal entry</li>
                    <li>Cleaned up the html of this file (though still undecided on what requires a new paragraph)</li>
                </ul>
            
            <p>
                What I want to do next:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Update my handwritten notebook (don't ask me why)</li>
                    <li>Play around with some CSS here</li>
                </ul>
            
            <p>
                Now this looks more like a journal!

                Did none of that and it’s well past midnight, so technically didn’t do anything on the 20th. 
                Consistency is tough. Also, to be honest, I wrote this on my phone to copy here later. 
                Nowhere to go but up I guess.

                Well, looks like I'm finally getting my shit together and actually doing something!
                Wouldn't say I've learned anything new today, but I did refresh my memory on git and github basics.
                I'm also braving VS Code, about which I've been complaining for awhile now, but I do want to 
                continue with The Odin Project, which uses it, and am considering the freeCodeCamp 2022 challenge, 
                which uses it too. It's okay, I'll get used to it, I'm sure.
                Anyway, it's getting pretty late now so I'll wrap this up. The whole point was to START.
                This way I'll have something to work on.
                Tomorrow I want to put some actual thought into it lol and make it look way neater.
