        <p>Well, looks like I'm finally getting my shit together and actually doing something!
           Wouldn't say I've learned anything new today, but I did refresh my memory on git and github basics.
           I'm also braving VS Code, about which I've been complaining for awhile now, but I do want to 
           continue with The Odin Project, which uses it, and am considering the freeCodeCamp 2022 challenge, 
           which uses it too. It's okay, I'll get used to it, I'm sure.
           Anyway, it's getting pretty late now so I'll wrap this up. The whole point was to START.
           This way I'll have something to work on.
           Tomorrow I want to put some actual thought into it lol and make it look way neater.</p>
