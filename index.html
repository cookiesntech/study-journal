            <h2>Thursday, Jan 27th</h2>
            <p>
                Which brings us to today.
                I intended to do more, but as you can see, I'm having a hard time focusing these days. What I'd still like to do by the end of the day is:
                <ul>
                    <li>Reorganize this html file - it's only been a week and it's already getting pretty long. Maybe I didn't think this through. I have to look up how people organize super long html files and is there a better way to do it for what I'm using it.</li>
                    <li>Make the other pages - once I figure out the org...</li>
                </ul>
                Ohhh wait a moment! I'm getting too caught up in trying to make things perfect. This is not the time for that. Come on, let's get those pages up, so I can have something to work on later!
            </p>
            <p>
                See, that's much better! I have all my pages now and created a CSS file too. It's crazy how far three simple declarations can go. It's midnight now, so I'm going to head to bed.
            </p>
            <p>
                What I did today:
                <ul>
                    <li>Pages - created the rest of the html pages
                    <li>Navigation - made all pages accessible from each other</li>
                    <li>Sections - for each journal entry, with alternating classes to separate them better visually</li>
                    <li>CSS - created the file and made a couple of declarations</li>
                    <li>Journal - wrote entries for today and the previous two days</li>
                    <li>GitHub - been committing all along</li>
                </ul>
                Not bad given how much time I wasted scrolling through twitter lol
            </p>
            <p>
                What I want to do next:
                <ul>
                    <li>Other pages - add some content to Resources and Notes, consider writing an About page</li>
                    <li>CSS - read more, pick colour palette and fonts, style nav bar</li>
                    <li>GitHub - improve my commit messages, now I'm pretty much writing one for the batch of commits but it doesn't appear very practical</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>Wednesday, Jan 26th</h2>
            <p>
                Day skipped, had to work. I attempted to watch class5 of 100devs but couldn't concentrate.
            </p>

            <h2>Tuesday, Jan 25th</h2>
            <p>
                Alright, so it's actually two days later now and I'm writing this as a catch-up. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I also just deleted everything I'd written, because I got way off track and forgot what my point was.
            </p>
            <p>
                Does anyone else struggle to stay focused sometimes? What, everyone? Good, I'm not alone then :D
            </p>
            <p>
                Since I'll have to write an entry for today as well, I'll just jump straight to it and share what I did on Tuesday:
                <ul>
                    <li>Fixed my git/GitHub issues - I made a second account to "start over" and was having troubles connecting the correct ones. I'd be logged in as account2 on my machine and on GitHub, but when trying to commit, I'd get an error that account1 isn't authorised to do that. Drove me nuts. Fixed it. Felt great.</li>
                    <li>Pushed my journal - as I'd given up on the previous issue, I had just uploaded my journal files to GitHub via the upload file button. Don't shame me. Then I had to find out how to select the version of the file I want. Ah, the ups and downs we go through...</li>
                    <li>Edited the index.html - actually did that before pushing. Applied some of the new things I've learned from 100devs.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                What I learned:
                <ul>
                    <li>(aaaand my mind went blank and I drifted away straight back to twitter. *le sigh*)</li>
                    <li>git/GitHub configuration - I feel less intimidated by it now and can't wait to collect some green squares soon!</li>
                    <li>Working with VS Code - I used my dislike to it as an excuse to not build anything. Lame, I know. That's why I sucked it up and just kept going. I dislike it less now.</li>
                    <li>Probably some more things, that I've already forgotten, so they don't really count, do they?</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Now let's jump back to the present.

            <h2>Saturday-Monday, Jan 22nd-24th</h2>
            <p>
                Days skipped. Because that's allowed too.

            <h2>Friday, Jan 21st</h2>
            <p>
                Okay, I actually learned stuff today!
                Let’s back up a bit. So I made a twitter account because apparently it’s important. Whatever, I just deleted reddit from my phone, I could replace it with another time-draining thing, right? Anyway, you know how social media is and right now everyone seems to be doing 100devs.
            </p>
            <p>
                I love jumping to new things just so I don’t have to keep doing what I’m doing, so I’ve really been itching to give it a go.
                I was warned against it because “don’t waste your time, 30 weeks are you kidding me, you can do it so much faster, do the odin project, etc.”. And I don’t disagree, but the fomo is real, y’all.
                So I came home after work, realized it’s Friday and I’m too broke to go out and have fun, was probably going to waste a couple hours watching random netflix shit. A great time to waste on 100devs!
            </p>
            <p>
                First up, I loved Leon, which is what made me stick around. I do, however, have to admit I totally see the “time wasting” point. Not judging, I understand different people learn at different paces and if I were a teacher, I’d go super slow too.
            </p>
            <p>
                Those who want to speed it up, are free to do so.
                Which is what I did. Like, way up.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m glad I stuck with it though, because honestly, this was the most comprehensive explanation of html I’ve come across so far.
            </p>
            <p>
                I started with cs50, which was mostly c and python. I only got a glimpse of html/css and javascript towards the end. And it was a bit “come on, you’ve done c and python already, this is no big deal” style, which I guess mostly means rushed. 
                I then did The Odin Projects Foundations part, again with a bit html and css (haven’t done the js part yet). It was easy enough, sure. Comprehensive? They probably get to that later.
            </p>
            <p>
                My key takeaways from the first three classes:
                <ul>
                    <li>Separation of concerns - I loved this way of putting it and the idea of compartmentalizing everything. HTML is for content, CSS is for style and JS is for function.</li>
                    <li>I loved the peanut m&ms analogy too - The peanut is the essence, which is HTML. The chocolate is a bonus, which is CSS and then there’s a thin coating to pimp it up (I personally know the m&ms coating’s true purpose and it sure isn’t an “optional” thing, but I’ll let it slide lol), which is JavaScript. For the sake of accessibility even when the internet is shit, it’s important to focus on the essence and keep it light on the bonus and pimping it up parts.</li>
                    <li>Each tag has its purpose. Its purpose should never be style.</li>
                    <li>The “head” contains the information that is for the browser. The “body” is what is shown to the user. The “you can see my sexy body but you can’t see what’s inside my head” was hilarious and a great way to remember it.</li>
                    <li>Drawing out the elements of a webpage and deconstructing it goes a long way towards understanding what to use where.</li>
                    <li>The tags themselves are easy to lookup and use (mdn is a friend)</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                What I did today:
                <ul>
                    <li>Watched first three classes of 100devs</li>
                    <li>Wrote a proper journal entry</li>
                    <li>Cleaned up the html of this file (though still undecided on what requires a new paragraph)</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                What I want to do next:
                <ul>
                    <li>Update my handwritten notebook (don't ask me why)</li>
                    <li>Play around with some CSS here</li>
            </p>
            <p>
                Now this looks more like a journal!

            <h2>Thursday, Jan 20th</h2>
            <p>
                Did none of that and it’s well past midnight, so technically didn’t do anything on the 20th. 
                Consistency is tough. Also, to be honest, I wrote this on my phone to copy here later. 
                Nowhere to go but up I guess.

            <h2>Wednesday, Jan 19th</h2>
            <p>
                Well, looks like I'm finally getting my shit together and actually doing something!
                Wouldn't say I've learned anything new today, but I did refresh my memory on git and github basics.
                I'm also braving VS Code, about which I've been complaining for awhile now, but I do want to 
                continue with The Odin Project, which uses it, and am considering the freeCodeCamp 2022 challenge, 
                which uses it too. It's okay, I'll get used to it, I'm sure.
                Anyway, it's getting pretty late now so I'll wrap this up. The whole point was to START.
                This way I'll have something to work on.
                Tomorrow I want to put some actual thought into it lol and make it look way neater.
