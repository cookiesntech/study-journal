            <h2>Tuesday, Feb 1st</h2>
            <p>New day, new month, new me? Lol no, that's not how it works.</p>
            <p>I need a plan for today, otherwise I'll just end up staring at the screen and scrolling through random things without actually doing anything.</p>
            <p>I think I'll explore <a href ="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/" target="_blank">Angela Yu's bootcamp</a> a bit more today. I've paid for it, might as well.</p>
            <p>I'll also revisit <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/" target="_blank">The Odin Project</a>'s CSS foundations to make sure I haven't missed anything.</p>
            <p>My goal with that is to fill out my notes for HTML and CSS, summarizing everything I've learned so far, in a way that makes them comprehensive enough to no longer need other resources on subjects I've already covered. Quite the sentence but it's ok, I get what I mean.</p>
            <p>Subgoal is to add some tweaks to this project even though I don't have any specific ideas in mind yet. Let's see how it goes.</p>
            <br>
            <p>So I have been going over the bootcamp and I do know a lot of those things already, which makes me feel quite good about myself, ngl.</p>
            <p>Then I realised what is it that I keep forgetting - the <a href="https://learn.shayhowe.com/" target="_blank">Shay Howe</a> reading homework for 100devs! Every once in a while I notice someone on twitter posting some cool things they've done to their CSS layouts and I'm like "But <em>how</em>?? Leon didn't say anything about that..." before I see their Shay Howe-related caption. So that's <em>howe!</em> (sorry I had to)</p>
            <p>I did come up with something to add here - a little section on the side (could it even be an &lt;aside&gt;??) where I put a photo of myself with a bit of text about me/this project.</p>
            <p>I've also been working on a "step by step" page, which is literally what it says. I'm curious how many steps it takes to build something "presentable" (as per my definition of it in relation to my <a href="goals.html" target="_blank_">goals</a>). And, of course, if anyone asks me "how do I make a journal for myself" I can show them precisely how I've done it.</p>
            <br>
            <p>*le sigh* I foolishly decided to go for it with the side bar and now I've broken everything.</p> 
            <p>Thank you, git & GitHub, for keeping the previous version intact, I don't know what I'd do without you. Certainly worth the headaches of setting you up properly.</p>
            <p>I hope this side bar is worth it too one day, but today it isn't. I'm going to put it out there anyway because I do like the general idea, but there's still many things to improve.</p>

            <h2>Monday, Jan 31st</h2>
            <p>Oops, almost missed this one.</p>
            <p>I haven't had a productive day, I'm just here for my green square, don't judge.</p>
            <p>I'm pretty sure I made some other changes last night that I saved to the files, but it was 3am so I really can't tell you what they were.</p>
            <p>One thing I tried to learn (or understand rather) is what is Node.js and what does it do exactly. I have to admit, that's the first concept I've encountered so far that is genuinely confusing. When I googled it, I expected to see "language" or "framework", but no <cite>"Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment"</cite>. Thanks!</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-exactly-is-node-js-ae36e97449f5" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a> helped a little, but I'll look more into it tomorrow</p>
            <p>Aaaaand that's it for today.</p>
        </section>


        <section class="b">
            <h2>Sunday, Jan 30th</h2>
            <p>Starting this entry early, I'll write as I go along today.</p>
            <p>I fixed the nested list, which was apparently so basic that I found the solution on <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Create-a-Nested-List-in-HTML" target="_blank">wikiHow</a> lol</p>
            <p>I realised I have to post a link to this out in the world so I put a quick disclaimer on top in case anyone reads it. Also because I want to make it look like a (don't even know what they're called) notification banner? Thought it would be a nice thing to learn.</p>
            <p>I then hosted a quick TPOW weekly catch-up voice chat to see how everyone is doing. I'm not much of a speaker, so this is helpful to get used to it. Kitchen communication tends to be contained within 1-5 words which isn't really sufficient here :D</p>
            <p>We were talking about how to get started on a project and I had to praise this study journal idea.</p>
            <p>It's the simplest of things, very low-pressure as you can totally just start with html and it's very easy to grow, because you always come up with little adjustments to make.</p>
            <p>I also noted that I've chosen to see it as a never-ending project, because there'll always be more things I want to tweak the more I learn. It's nice to know I don't <em>have to</em> finish it because it will never <em>be</em> finished. No deadline does take a lot of pressure off of it.</p>
            <p>Anyway, I pushed this to GitHub a bit prematurely (as in, before I saved my files lol) so I'll give it another go, hopefully I don't forget anything this time.</p>
            <p>Oh, one last thing - since it feels like I'm wrapping this up for the day, tomorrow I want to think about how exactly I'd like to format these journal entries, because it bugs me that it's always different. Yes, it's a journal and allowed to be disorganized, but it's a <em>study</em> journal, so I feel like it shouldn't be.</p> 
            <p>Have I said "study journal" enough times today already?</p>

            <h2>Saturday, Jan 29th</h2>
            <p>Haven't done much today, but it's not too bad.</p>
            <p>I caught up with the 100devs videos (and understood why I was having issues with that floating navbar yesterday, that's what I get for jumping straight in lol).</p>
            <p>I practiced my typing and realized that's a great way to make yourself look busy - <a href="https://www.keybr.com/" target="_blank">here's a link</a> if you're ever in need :D I did find it a bit annoying; I get the benefits of using randomly generated letter sequences, but figuring them out for sure affects my speed and accuracy. That being said, I'm noticing that I'm already typing way faster, so they must be doing something right. Those Xs really got me though.</p>
            <p>I just started reading a bit of Shay Howe but it's late so it probably won't last long.</p>
            <p>Oh, he did however remind me of the <a href="https://validator.w3.org/" target="_blank">W3C validators</a> which I'm using to check my code for this, which is how I ended up opening VS Code at all today. Fun fact, there's no point in putting lists inside of paragraphs, which as I'm typing feels pretty obvious, but I've been doing it all along so I ended up having to edit them all.</p>
            <p>I also added target="_blank" to all the links so they open in new tabs now. Halleluja! I <em>hate it</em> when they don't, why do people do that??</p>
            <p>Woah, my elbow is sore (bad posture) but I don't seem to be able to stop myself from typing. That website broke me, don't do it.</p>
            <p>I'm going to walk away from the keyboard <span class="strikeThrough">now</span>.</p>
            <p>(Okay but first I'm just going to list some things I want to look up tomorrow and would surely forget if I don't write down)</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In goals.html I have a sub-list which apparently is not allowed or at least not the way I'm doing it; my CSS is all good though, so yay me!</li>
                <li>Speaking of CSS, this handwrite-y font is cute for the dates here but looks terrible on all other pages, have to find one I can use for that and maybe the navbar.</li>
                <li>There was something else too? Ah yes, fix that float, girl!</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Walking away now.</p>

            <br>
            <p>P.S. GitHub pro tip - push things around midnight and you can green up two days in 5 min! I won't tell if you don't.</p>

            <h2 title="learned a new trick, had to try it">Friday, Jan 28th</h2>
            <p>I may not be done for the day yet, but the day is almost done, so I'll just go ahead.</p>
            <p>Usual focus issues, blah blah, maybe I'll get better at it, maybe I won't.</p>

            <p>I did however manage to do some of the things I intended to and still have time for a bit more. I started with the easiest, which was picking out some colours and fonts. Didn't spend too much time on it, don't know if I love them, but for the purposes - totally sufficient. I'm <em>not</em> a designer. It's <em>not</em> what I'm learning right now.</p>

            <p>Once I got my colours, I really wanted to style that navbar. I was supposed to read more about CSS before I jump into it, but I didn't and so it doesn't really look the way I want it to AND my stylesheet is a bit of a mess, but to be fair - I don't hate it either. (gonna write more later)</p>

            <p>(It's later now) Got some new ideas, will work on them in the following days. Here's what I did today:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>CSS - read a little bit about it from <a href="https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/Css/css_navbar.asp" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS" target="_blank">here</a>;</li>
                    <li>Styling - linked fonts and selected colour palette;</li>
                    <li>Navbar - this one was a pain in the ass, but I almost got it to look the way I want!</li>
                    <li>Title attribute - saw this trick on twitter and snuck it in so I don't forget it.</li>
                </ul>
            
            <p>What I want to do tomorrow:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pages - I still don't have much on any of the others; also after I looked at my screenshots, I thought it would be cool to make a page for them too, that way I'd get to play around with images and I'll keep a visual track of my progress; another page idea is a to-do list, but that could be part of Goals I suppose;</li>
                    <li>GitHub - Still haven't checked out the messages. Maybe I'll try to do today's commits one by one but that sounds even less practical;</li>
                    <li>OPEN LINKS IN NEW TABS GODDAMNIT!</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Thursday, Jan 27th</h2>
            <p>
                Which brings us to today.
                I intended to do more, but as you can see, I'm having a hard time focusing these days. What I'd still like to do by the end of the day is:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reorganize this html file - it's only been a week and it's already getting pretty long. Maybe I didn't think this through. I have to look up how people organize super long html files and is there a better way to do it for what I'm using it.</li>
                    <li>Make the other pages - once I figure out the org...</li>
                </ul>
                Ohhh wait a moment! I'm getting too caught up in trying to make things perfect. This is not the time for that. Come on, let's get those pages up, so I can have something to work on later!
            
            <p>
                See, that's much better! I have all my pages now and created a CSS file too. It's crazy how far three simple declarations can go. It's midnight now, so I'm going to head to bed.
            </p>
            <p>
                What I did today:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pages - created the rest of the html pages
                    <li>Navigation - made all pages accessible from each other</li>
                    <li>Sections - for each journal entry, with alternating classes to separate them better visually</li>
                    <li>CSS - created the file and made a couple of declarations</li>
                    <li>Journal - wrote entries for today and the previous two days</li>
                    <li>GitHub - been committing all along</li>
                </ul>
            <p>Not bad given how much time I wasted scrolling through twitter lol</p>
            <p>
                What I want to do next:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Other pages - add some content to Resources and Notes, consider writing an About page</li>
                    <li>CSS - read more, pick colour palette and fonts, style nav bar</li>
                    <li>GitHub - improve my commit messages, now I'm pretty much writing one for the batch of commits but it doesn't appear very practical</li>
                </ul>

                Day skipped, had to work. I attempted to watch class5 of 100devs but couldn't concentrate.

            <p>
                Alright, so it's actually two days later now and I'm writing this as a catch-up. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I also just deleted everything I'd written, because I got way off track and forgot what my point was.
            </p>
            <p>
                Does anyone else struggle to stay focused sometimes? What, everyone? Good, I'm not alone then :D
            </p>
            <p>
                Since I'll have to write an entry for today as well, I'll just jump straight to it and share what I did on Tuesday:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fixed my git/GitHub issues - I made a second account to "start over" and was having troubles connecting the correct ones. I'd be logged in as account2 on my machine and on GitHub, but when trying to commit, I'd get an error that account1 isn't authorised to do that. Drove me nuts. Fixed it. Felt great.</li>
                    <li>Pushed my journal - as I'd given up on the previous issue, I had just uploaded my journal files to GitHub via the upload file button. Don't shame me. Then I had to find out how to select the version of the file I want. Ah, the ups and downs we go through...</li>
                    <li>Edited the index.html - actually did that before pushing. Applied some of the new things I've learned from 100devs.</li>
                </ul>
            
            <p>
                What I learned:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>(aaaand my mind went blank and I drifted away straight back to twitter. *le sigh*)</li>
                    <li>git/GitHub configuration - I feel less intimidated by it now and can't wait to collect some green squares soon!</li>
                    <li>Working with VS Code - I used my dislike to it as an excuse to not build anything. Lame, I know. That's why I sucked it up and just kept going. I dislike it less now.</li>
                    <li>Probably some more things, that I've already forgotten, so they don't really count, do they?</li>
                </ul>
            
            <p>
                Now let's jump back to the present.

            <h2>Friday, Jan 21st</h2>
            <p>
                Okay, I actually learned stuff today!
                Let’s back up a bit. So I made a twitter account because apparently it’s important. Whatever, I just deleted reddit from my phone, I could replace it with another time-draining thing, right? Anyway, you know how social media is and right now everyone seems to be doing 100devs.
            </p>
            <p>
                I love jumping to new things just so I don’t have to keep doing what I’m doing, so I’ve really been itching to give it a go.
                I was warned against it because “don’t waste your time, 30 weeks are you kidding me, you can do it so much faster, do the odin project, etc.”. And I don’t disagree, but the fomo is real, y’all.
                So I came home after work, realized it’s Friday and I’m too broke to go out and have fun, was probably going to waste a couple hours watching random netflix shit. A great time to waste on 100devs!
            </p>
            <p>
                First up, I loved Leon, which is what made me stick around. I do, however, have to admit I totally see the “time wasting” point. Not judging, I understand different people learn at different paces and if I were a teacher, I’d go super slow too.
            </p>
            <p>
                Those who want to speed it up, are free to do so.
                Which is what I did. Like, way up.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m glad I stuck with it though, because honestly, this was the most comprehensive explanation of html I’ve come across so far.
            </p>
            <p>
                I started with cs50, which was mostly c and python. I only got a glimpse of html/css and javascript towards the end. And it was a bit “come on, you’ve done c and python already, this is no big deal” style, which I guess mostly means rushed. 
                I then did The Odin Projects Foundations part, again with a bit html and css (haven’t done the js part yet). It was easy enough, sure. Comprehensive? They probably get to that later.
            </p>
            <p>
                My key takeaways from the first three classes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Separation of concerns - I loved this way of putting it and the idea of compartmentalizing everything. HTML is for content, CSS is for style and JS is for function.</li>
                    <li>I loved the peanut m&ms analogy too - The peanut is the essence, which is HTML. The chocolate is a bonus, which is CSS and then there’s a thin coating to pimp it up (I personally know the m&ms coating’s true purpose and it sure isn’t an “optional” thing, but I’ll let it slide lol), which is JavaScript. For the sake of accessibility even when the internet is shit, it’s important to focus on the essence and keep it light on the bonus and pimping it up parts.</li>
                    <li>Each tag has its purpose. Its purpose should never be style.</li>
                    <li>The “head” contains the information that is for the browser. The “body” is what is shown to the user. The “you can see my sexy body but you can’t see what’s inside my head” was hilarious and a great way to remember it.</li>
                    <li>Drawing out the elements of a webpage and deconstructing it goes a long way towards understanding what to use where.</li>
                    <li>The tags themselves are easy to lookup and use (mdn is a friend)</li>
                </ul>
            
            <p>
                What I did today:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Watched first three classes of 100devs</li>
                    <li>Wrote a proper journal entry</li>
                    <li>Cleaned up the html of this file (though still undecided on what requires a new paragraph)</li>
                </ul>
            
            <p>
                What I want to do next:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Update my handwritten notebook (don't ask me why)</li>
                    <li>Play around with some CSS here</li>
                </ul>
            
            <p>
                Now this looks more like a journal!

            <p>
                Did none of that and it’s well past midnight, so technically didn’t do anything on the 20th. 
                Consistency is tough. Also, to be honest, I wrote this on my phone to copy here later. 
                Nowhere to go but up I guess.

            <p>
                Well, looks like I'm finally getting my shit together and actually doing something!
                Wouldn't say I've learned anything new today, but I did refresh my memory on git and github basics.
                I'm also braving VS Code, about which I've been complaining for awhile now, but I do want to 
                continue with The Odin Project, which uses it, and am considering the freeCodeCamp 2022 challenge, 
                which uses it too. It's okay, I'll get used to it, I'm sure.
                Anyway, it's getting pretty late now so I'll wrap this up. The whole point was to START.
                This way I'll have something to work on.
                Tomorrow I want to put some actual thought into it lol and make it look way neater.
