# study-journal
This is my first personal project.
It's a journal where I track my progress while using the new skills I acquire.
To begin with, I'm making four simple html pages.
The index page, containing the journal entries.
A goals page, where I list my learning goals.
A resources page, with links to the resources I use.
A notes page, to keep track of the knowledge I gain on various languages,tools and technologies.
This readme will be improved overtime as well, don't worry :D
